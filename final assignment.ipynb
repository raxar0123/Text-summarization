Its main figures were Bomis CEO Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia.[1][21] Nupedia was initially licensed under its own Nupedia Open Content License, but before Wikipedia was founded, Nupedia switched to the GNU Free Documentation License at the urging of Richard Stallman.[22] Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia,[23][24] while Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal.[25] On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a \"feeder\" project for Nupedia.[26]\n",

Otherwise, there were initially relatively few rules, and it operated independently of Nupedia.[23] Bomis originally intended it as a business for profit.[33]\n",
